`go-didplc`: did:plc in golang
==============================

This golang package will eventually be an implementation of the did:plc specification in golang, including at a minimum verification of DID documents from a PLC operation log.

## Developer Quickstart

Install golang. We are generally using v1.22+.

In this directory (`go-didplc/`) there is a Makefile with helpers for running tests, etc. Run `make help` to list available commands.
